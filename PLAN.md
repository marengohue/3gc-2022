We have 4x PC and 2x switch setup before the event.
People challenge each other in duels and earn points in the PC bracket, and also partake in party games whislt they wait for their duel turns.
The people by the end of the even having the biggest sum of points in each bracket, take the cup.

Original estimate: 3hrs of gaming starting 4.30PM on 27th of May.

Alternative ideas:
Maybe make it a several-day event? One bracket per day.
