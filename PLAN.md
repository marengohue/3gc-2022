# Overview
Welcome to the Golden Gaming Gods and Goddessess 2022 Championship!

We are proud to annouce the docket for the event. Below you can find some general rules but we are very flexible and will adjust on the fly.
There is also going to be food and beverages, so you are free to skip dinner that day.

The event is happening on Friday 27th of May, starting at 4 o'clock, but the gaming is likely to start at around 5.

Two main categories for the event are:

## PC Gaming Gods ##
- PC bracket will contain a few duel games.
- Gain points based on your performance (3 pts for attending, 3 pts for winning).
- At the end, people will get genre champion belts (Golden Strategy God, Golden FPS God, etc...)
- Matchmaking is challenge based and is done live and the opponent has no right to decline unless they have concluded their participation in the event. Scaredy-cats get deducted points if they do. Basically, just challenge a person to a duel and record the outcome.
- Fun bonuses are going to be distributed at the end of the match if you think you are worthy. Examples might include the following:
  1) Most inebriated person in a match gains extra points - *drunk bonus*
  2) *style points* - say, for Dune - defeat only only using Trikes, your imagination is the key here).
- In order to gain these bonus points, both participants have to acknowledge it - be a good sport.
- Above all, have fun. If you need help setting up for the event or if you don't have some of the games on the list, ask @eugene.rebedailo on slack - he will gift you the missing games on steam.

## Party Gaming Gods ##
- Switches and games are present at the event and are happening in 4-6 player setting. 
- You gain score based on placement in the chaotic brawl
- You are free to bring your peripherals if you prefer, but we provide you with everything you need to partake.
